            Lynus Woo: A Pilgrimage in Colours explores and stretches the possibilities of colours in capturing the
            multifaceted human emotions and inner thoughts that might not be evident in one's immediate countenance.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-6">
            This exhibition primarily features works produced since 2019 upon Lynus's return to Hong Kong. It was a time
            when he was reacclimating to a city that he was born into, which has evolved immensely during his years
            living and studying abroad and continues to undergo rapid social climate change. Moreover, the arrival of
            the global pandemic prompted him to reflect upon the agents of change, seek consolation and, in turn,
            self-conciliation and express an understanding of these seismic shifts in recent collective memory through
            cathartic output: a pilgrimage conducted in colours.

            The show also inaugurates REP., a brainchild conceived by the artist during the city's pandemic lockdown.
            The fitness centre incorporates a gallery space that promotes creativity, innovation and social interaction.
            The concept aims to blur the boundary between fitness and art, driven by the artist's philosophical belief
            that the human body is a living sculpture that constantly evolves, as does the versatile design of REP.’s
            fitness space.

            「胡智同：色彩的巡禮」探索並試圖擴展色彩在捕捉人類多面且不露神色的情感與內心的可能性。
        </p>

        <p class="pb-6">
            藝術家在國外留學生活的這些年裡，香港歷盡變遷，而是次展覽則主要展出胡智同自2019 年回流香港後創作的作品。回港後的胡智同除了要重新適應這個城市以及其當時的社會氛圍，2019
            冠狀病毒所引發的全球大流行疫情亦促使他對生活變動深入反思。為了面對世界及自身歷史性的轉折，並且在這些變革中尋求自我慰解和宣洩，胡智同透過藝術創作，以色彩進行了一場內觀巡禮。
        </p>

        <p>
            是次展覽亦為 REP. 健身中心的揭幕禮之一。REP. 是胡智同在疫情早期，城市封鎖期間構想而成的多元化健身空間。有別於一般的健身中心，REP.
            包含了一個旨在提倡創意創新和社交互動的快閃空間。藝術家深信人體是一個具不斷進化潛能的活雕塑，而正是這個哲學信念，促成了這個模糊了健身與藝術之間的界限的多功能概念空間。

            Lynus Woo (born 1995) graduated from the Ruskin School of Art at Oxford University in 2017. He has since
            taken up a prolific career as an active entrepreneur, a bodybuilder, a personal fitness trainer while
            pursuing his unceasing passion for artistic creation at the same time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm pb-6">
            Lynus's works primarily with oil paint as his preferred medium. His artistic practice focuses on colour
            perception as an entity that provides a conceptual framework that embodies, fosters and represents human
            emotions. His oeuvre to date hence presents a shift in subject matter from streetscapes to people inhabiting
            these spaces, and subsequently narrowing down to portraitures of his acquaintances, friends and family, and
            ultimately, himself. Viewers will find influences of celebrated contemporary artists including Lucian Freud,
            Cecily Brown and Jenny Saville in his modus operandi.

            胡智同（1995 年生）在2017 年畢業於牛津大學拉斯金藝術學院。畢業後的他身兼企業家、健美選手、私人健身教練等多職。與此同時，他亦不懈積極追求自身對藝術創作的熱忱。
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm pb-6">
            胡智同的作品以油畫為主，著重於色彩感知概念，並以其作為創作框架，探索人類如何「感形於色」。藝術家創作至今，筆下主題已經歷數個階段的演變。他的畫作從早期對街景和穿梭這些空間的人們的捕捉，聚焦至親朋戚友的肖像描繪，最後把自己變成主要的創作題材。觀者可從胡智同的作畫手法中發現盧西安・弗洛伊德、塞西莉・布朗和珍妮・薩維爾斯等著名當代藝術家的影響。
